Once you have AI members set up, you can assign tasks and coordinate their work through simple messaging.

## Assigning Tasks with @Mentions

Use `@` followed by the member's name to assign tasks:

```
@Coder Please implement the login form with email validation.
```

You can also mention multiple agents in one message:

```
@Coder implement the API endpoint
@Writer document the new endpoint in the README
```

### Using the Mention Selector

For convenience, use the **Mention agents** selector:

1. Click the **@** button in the message input
2. Select one or more AI members
3. Write your message
4. Selected mentions are automatically included

<Tip>
You can combine both methods - type `@name` in your message AND use the selector for additional mentions.
</Tip>

## Message Features

### Text and Images

Messages support:
- Plain text instructions
- Image attachments (for visual context)

### Reference Previous Messages

Quote a previous message to provide context:

1. Hover over any message
2. Click the **Reply** button
3. Your new message will reference the quoted content

This is useful for follow-up instructions or corrections.

## How Task Execution Works

When you mention an AI member:

1. **Received** - The agent acknowledges your message
2. **Running** - The agent starts working on the task
3. **Completed** - The task is finished successfully
4. **Failed** - The agent encountered an error

<Note>
You can see the current status of each mention directly in the message.
</Note>

### Queue Behavior

If an agent is already running:
- New tasks are queued automatically
- Tasks execute in order when the agent becomes available
- You'll see a confirmation when queuing a task to a busy agent

### Chain Collaboration

Agents can mention other agents in their responses, enabling workflows like:

1. You ask `@Engineer` for a solution design
2. Engineer creates a plan and asks `@Coder` to implement it
3. Coder implements and asks `@Reviewer` to check the code

<Warning>
Chain triggers have a depth limit to prevent infinite loops. An agent cannot mention itself.
</Warning>

## Stopping an Agent

If you need to interrupt a running agent:

1. Find the running member in the sidebar
2. Click **Stop**
3. The agent will halt its current task

## Best Practices

### Clear Instructions

Be specific about what you want:

**Good:**
```
@Coder Add a logout button to the header. It should clear the session and redirect to /login.
```

**Vague:**
```
@Coder fix the auth
```

### One Task Per Mention

For complex work, break it down:

```
@Coder First, create the database schema for user profiles.
```

Then follow up:

```
@Coder Now add the API endpoints for profile CRUD operations.
```

### Use the Right Agent for the Job

Match tasks to agent roles:

- Documentation tasks → Writer agent
- Code implementation → Coder agent
- Architecture questions → Engineer agent
