AI Members are the coding agents that work on your behalf in a chat session. Each member has a specific role, workspace, and capabilities.

## Adding an AI Member

1. Open your chat session
2. In the right sidebar, click **Add AI member**
3. Fill in the required configuration

### Configuration Options

| System Prompt | Yes | Instructions that define the agent's role and behavior |
| Workspace Path | Yes | The directory where this agent will work |
| Model Variant | No | Specific model configuration (if available) |

<Note>
The **Name** must be unique within the session and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (maximum 10 characters).

## Writing Effective System Prompts

The system prompt defines what your AI member does. Keep it clear and focused:

**Good examples:**
- "You are a documentation writer. Focus on clear, user-friendly content."
- "You are a code reviewer. Check for bugs, performance issues, and best practices."
- "You are a backend engineer. Implement features following the project's existing patterns."

**Tips:**
- Be specific about the role and responsibilities
- Mention any constraints or preferences
- Keep it concise - agents work better with clear directions

## Managing AI Members

<Warning>
The workspace path cannot be changed after creation. If you need a different workspace, create a new AI member.
</Warning>

2. Click **Delete**

## Member States
