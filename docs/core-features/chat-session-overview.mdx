Agent ChatGroup enables multiple AI coding agents to work together on your projects through **Chat Sessions** - collaborative workspaces where you coordinate AI team members to complete complex tasks.

## What is a Chat Session?

A Chat Session is like a group chat where you and multiple AI agents collaborate on coding tasks. Each session acts as a dedicated workspace where:

- You assign tasks to different AI agents using simple @mentions
- Agents work in their own workspaces and report back
- All conversations and code changes are tracked in one place

## Core Value

Traditional coding agents work in isolation - one agent, one task. Agent ChatGroup changes this by enabling:

- **Team Collaboration**: Assign different roles to different agents (Writer, Engineer, Coder, etc.)
- **Parallel Work**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different parts of a project
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents can reference each other's work and build on previous outputs

## Use Cases

Chat Sessions are perfect for complex tasks that benefit from division of labor:

| Task Type | Example Roles |
|-----------|---------------|
| Documentation | Writer for content, Engineer for technical details |
| Feature Development | Coder for implementation, Reviewer for code quality |
| Project Setup | Coder for scaffolding, Downloader for assets |
| Research & Implementation | Explorer for research, Coder for execution |

<Tip>
Start with a simple two-agent setup to get familiar with the workflow, then expand your team as needed.
