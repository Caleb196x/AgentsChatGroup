Chat sessions are the foundation of your AI collaboration workflow. Here's how to create and manage them effectively.

## Creating a New Session

1. Navigate to the **Chat** page (`/chat`)
2. Click **New Session** in the left sidebar
3. A new session is created and you're automatically redirected to it

<Tip>
Each new session starts empty, ready for you to add AI members and begin collaborating.
</Tip>

## Editing Session Title

Click on the session title at the top to edit it. Keep titles short and descriptive (maximum 20 characters) to help you identify sessions later.

Good examples:
- "Docs Update"
- "Auth Feature"
- "Bug Fix #123"

## Session Actions

### Archive a Session

When you finish a project or want to pause work:

1. Open the session you want to archive
2. Click the **Archive** button
3. The session becomes read-only

<Note>
Archived sessions preserve all messages and AI members, but you cannot send new messages or modify members.
</Note>

### Restore a Session

To continue work on an archived session:

1. Find the archived session in your list
2. Click **Restore**
3. The session becomes active again

### Delete a Session

To permanently remove a session:

1. Open the session
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a session removes all messages and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Understanding Session States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Active | Normal working state - you can send messages and manage AI members |
| Archived | Read-only state - messages and members are preserved but locked |
