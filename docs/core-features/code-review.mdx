When AI members complete coding tasks, you can review their work and manage the overall session through built-in tools.

## Viewing Code Changes

After an agent completes a task, you'll see a **Code changes** card below their message.

Click to open the **Diff Viewer** which shows:
- Files added, modified, or deleted
- Line-by-line changes with syntax highlighting
- Before and after comparison

<Tip>
The diff viewer only shows tracked git changes. Make sure your workspace is a git repository.
</Tip>

## Workspace Drawer

Click on an AI member's workspace to open the **Workspace Drawer**, which provides:

### Workspace Path
The directory where this agent works.

### Run History
A list of all task runs for this agent, showing:
- When each task ran
- Whether it succeeded or failed
- Quick access to outputs

### Run Logs
Detailed logs from each execution, useful for debugging or understanding what the agent did.

## Understanding Run Outputs

Each time an agent runs, it generates several outputs:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Input | The task prompt sent to the agent |
| Output | The agent's response and summary |
| Log | Detailed execution log |
| Diff | Code changes (if any git changes were made) |

<Note>
Large diffs (over 4KB) are truncated for performance. You can view the full changes in your git client.
</Note>

## New Files

When an agent creates new files that aren't tracked by git, they appear in a separate **Untracked files** section.

<Warning>
Untracked files larger than 1MB are not captured.
</Warning>

## Running Control

### Stopping an Agent

If an agent is taking too long or going in the wrong direction:

1. Find the running agent in the sidebar (shows "Running" status)
2. Click the **Stop** button
3. The agent will halt its current task

<Tip>
After stopping an agent, you can send a new message with clearer instructions.
</Tip>

### Task Queue

When you send a task to an agent that's already running:
- The new task is automatically queued
- A confirmation dialog appears
- Tasks execute in order when the agent finishes

## Context Management

The system automatically manages conversation context for your AI agents.

### How Context Works

Each AI member receives:
- **Session members** - Who's in the chat and their roles
- **Recent messages** - The conversation history
- **Referenced content** - Any quoted messages or attachments

### Automatic Context Compression

To keep conversations efficient:
- Up to 30 messages are retained in context
- The 5 most recent messages are always kept in full
- Older messages are automatically summarized

<Note>
You don't need to manage context manually - the system handles it automatically while preserving important information.
</Note>

## Session Management Tools

### Search Messages

Use the search feature to find specific messages or discussions across the session.

### Bulk Delete

In cleanup mode, you can select and delete multiple messages at once.

### Message History

The full conversation history is preserved and available for reference at any time.

### Archiving Sessions

When a project is complete or paused:

1. Click **Archive** on the session
2. The session becomes read-only
3. All messages and members are preserved

To continue work later, click **Restore** to reactivate the session.

## Tips for Effective Review

1. **Check the diff first** - Quickly see what code changed
2. **Read the output** - Understand what the agent intended to do
3. **Review logs if needed** - Dig into details when something seems off
4. **Follow up with mentions** - Ask the agent to revise or explain if needed

@Coder The login function looks good, but can you add error handling for invalid credentials?
